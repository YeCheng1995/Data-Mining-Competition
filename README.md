##  Overview
The notebook includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning model evaluation. The dataset used is bank_data.pkl, which is loaded and analyzed in the notebook.

## Requirements

The notebook uses the following Python libraries:

pickle (for loading serialized data)

matplotlib, seaborn (for data visualization)

numpy, pandas (for data manipulation)

sklearn (for machine learning tasks such as model training and evaluation)

##  Notebook Contents

Data Loading: Reads bank_data.pkl and extracts a subset (7500 rows for analysis).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes the dataset distribution, feature correlations, and missing values.

Data Preprocessing: Cleans and processes the data, including handling missing values and feature engineering.

Model Training & Evaluation: Implements machine learning models, evaluates performance using accuracy score, and optimizes hyperparameters.
